# python-code-base
This is the file you're looking for if you need an introduction for this repository.

I will be adding python scripts that I learn from various books that i read so that I can have a collection of well written and documented code for further reference. You are welcome to contribute asa long as it is based on python.

All the code I upload is NOT totally written by me, I read, learn and execute it on my laptop. Once I am done tweaking with the code I upload it to the repository and I hold no guarantee to the content.

Peace!
